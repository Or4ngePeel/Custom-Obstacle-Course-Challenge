# Custom-Obstacle-Course-Challenge
Kunj, Nevin, and Tanish
The first obstacle our vex robot will have to face is the push door. We added this obstacle for a unique touch to our obstacle course and to challenge our VEX robot. You get through it by having to push it in a circular motion to the point where it has contact with a still wall. This is how you complete the first challenge and with the second challenge is the double diagonal push doors. The VEX Robot gets through this by running into the two doors pushing through them. Although you get passed the second challenge you are instantly met with the third challenge which is the spinning door. This challenge can interact with the second obstacle making it more difficult, but you get past it by fixing the spinning door into a position which allows you to open the diagonal doors therefore allowing you to get through both obstacles at once. It can still act as an obstacle itself though as the VEX robot may also have to push past the spinning door. Thats how you complete the third obstacle, but you don't get a break because after that you have the fourth obstacle which are a bunch of scattered shafts on the ground that kind of act like bumps on a road but more deadly as the shafts roll. To get past this obstacle you must carefully drive over them, pushing the door in front open allowing the VEX robot to go onto the last challenge. When you get past through the fourth challenge you can already see the fifth challenge where you must move the ball in a straight line to the end of the course by pushing a wall which isnâ€™t anchored to anything so you must evenly push it and our robot will need to be perfectly straight which doing that will allow you to complete the extensive obstacle course.
